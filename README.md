This program allows for managment of field data. It makes API calls in Postman to allow for fields to be created, read, updated, and deleted. These same capabilities
are also applicable to data catergories linked to each field, including address, field operation, area, and detail. Operations applied to fields also store the 
time at which the operation was completed. This allows the user to call all field operations applied within a given time window.
